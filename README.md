# ASM-Examples

### ASM Calculator (calculator.asm)
An assembly langauge program that takes two integers from user input and returns the sum,
difference, product, and quotient with remainder of those two integers.
This program also detects and notifies the user if the second integer is larger than the first, return a
floating point quotient of the two integers, and loop the program until the user enters the appropriate key command
to quit.

### ASM Fibonacci (fibonacci.asm)
An assembly langauge program that takes a user defined integer, with an upper limit of 46, 
ensured by post-test loop validation, and returns the sequence of second-order Fibonacci numbers to the nth term.
This program displays its output in two aligned colums, and it also does something incredible by testing user 
defined integers, up to 6,000,000, and stating whether or not they are Fibonacci numbers.

### ASM Negative Integer Accumulator (accumulator.asm)
This program prompts the user to enter negative integers in the range [-100...-1] and returns
the total count of integers entered, the sum of those integers, and the average of those integers rounded to the closest integer.
User input lines are numbered in place. Line numbers are incremented after each successful integer is entered.
The program also shows the average as a floating point number rounded to three decimal places.

### ASM Composites (composites.asm)
This program greets the user, prompts the for a number n, in the range [1...10000], validates that the user has entered 
a valid number, then displays the first n composite numbers.
The program displays its output in aligned columns. The program also displays results sequentially in groups of 90
composite numbers per page with each page displayed in place after prompting the user to continue.

### ASM Random Sort (randomsort.asm)
This program generates a user specified number of random integers in the range [100...999].
The program prints the unsorted list of random integers, sorts the list, displays the rounded median of 
the sorted list, and displays the sorted list. The program sorts the list using a recursive bubble sort.

### ASM Combinatorics (combinatorics.asm)
This program gives users randomly generated practice combinatorics problems and grades their performance.

#### ASM Template (template.asm)
Provides a template file for additional programs.
